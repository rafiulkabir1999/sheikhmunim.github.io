            Computer viruses have been around since the early days of computing. Here's a brief history of computer viruses:

The first computer virus: The first computer virus is believed to be the "Creeper" virus, which was created in the early 1970s by Bob Thomas. The virus was designed to infect DEC PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system. The Creeper virus displayed a message on infected machines that read: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"

The first PC virus: The first virus to infect personal computers was the "Brain" virus, which was created in 1986 by two brothers from Pakistan, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi. The virus was designed to infect IBM PC computers running MS-DOS. The Brain virus spread via infected floppy disks and displayed a message that read: "Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986 Basit & Amjad (pvt) Ltd. BRAIN COMPUTER SERVICES 730 NIZAM BLOCK ALLAMA IQBAL TOWN LAHORE-PAKISTAN PHONE: 430791,443248,280530. Beware of this VIRUS.... Contact us...."

The first macro virus: The first macro virus, 


which infects documents rather than programs, was the "Concept" virus, which was created in 1995. The Concept virus spread via infected Microsoft Word documents and was able to infect other documents on the same computer. The virus did not cause any damage, but it was able to spread quickly.

The first email virus: The first email virus was the "Melissa" virus, which was created in 1999 by David L. Smith. The Melissa virus spread via infected Microsoft Word documents attached to emails. When a user opened the attachment, the virus would infect the computer and then send itself to the first 50 contacts in the user's address book.

Modern viruses: Today, viruses continue to evolve and become more sophisticated. Modern viruses can infect not only computers but also smartphones and other devices. They can be spread through email, social media, and even USB drives. Some viruses are designed to steal personal information or to encrypt files and demand a ransom for their release.

It is important to note that creating, distributing, or using computer viruses is illegal and can cause serious harm to individuals and organizations.
